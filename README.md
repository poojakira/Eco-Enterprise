## 🏢 Portfolio Prototype Use-Cases

EcoTrack is built as a "Digital Twin of Sustainability" prototype. It demonstrates how to solve data integrity challenges for complex sustainability auditing.

- **Auditor Workflow**: Cryptographically verify 100k+ records in < 1s using the Merkle Ledger.
- **Executive Workflow**: Real-time "Net Liability" monitoring with ensemble AI forecasting.
- **Operational Workflow**: Identify and mitigate Scope 3 hotspots via the **Action Center**.

## 🏗️ Prototype Architecture
The Nexus architecture is designed for high-frequency telemetry $(10^6 \text{ records/month})$ utilizing a producer-consumer pattern and Merkle-tree anchoring.
