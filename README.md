## 🚀 Industrial Startup & Deployment

### 1. Multi-Environment Ignition
EcoTrack supports specialized orchestration profiles for `dev`, `stage`, and `prod`.
```bash
# Clone and enter the industrial nexus
git clone https://github.com/poojakira/Eco-Enterprise.git && cd Eco-Enterprise

# Configure environment (See backend/config/ and .env.example)
export ENV=development

# Launch Dockerized Infrastructure
docker-compose up --build
```
*Port Mapping: Dashboard (8501) | API (8000) | Metrics (8000/metrics)*

### 2. API Discovery (CURL)
```bash
# Ingest Industrial Telemetry
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data/ingest" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[{"sku_name": "Nexus-X", "carbon_footprint": 45.2, "region": "EU-West"}]'
```
